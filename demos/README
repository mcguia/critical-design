There are three example sites in this directory:

 1. simple
 2. simple_threads
 3. multiple
 4. custom_comments

1. The 'simple' demo site is a project with just one application called 'articles' with an 'Article' model whose instances accept comments. The example features: 

 * Comments have to be confirmed by email before they hit the database. 
 * Commenters may request follow up notifications.


2. The 'simple_threads' demo site extends the 'simple' demo functionality featuring:
 * Thread support for comments up to level 2


3. The 'multiple' demo shows a site using comments in 3 different models: 'Story', 'Quote', 'Release'. As in the simple demo, initial data provides entries and comments to all models. The blog app, that consist of stories and quotes, uses the templatetag 'render_last_xtdcomments' to show a list of the last 5 comments posted either to stories or quotes. It also gives access to a paginated comment list page that shows all comment posted to stories and quotes. The page uses a generic view with a query that make use of the special method 'for_app_models' of the 'XtdComment' manager, which retrieves comments posted to the models indicated in the query:
  
    queryset = XtdComment.objects.for_app_models("blog.story", "blog.quote")

The 'multiple' demo allows different maximum level of threading per app.model basis, by using both settings:

  * COMMENTS_XTD_MAX_THREAD_LEVEL = 3
  * COMMENTS_XTD_MAX_THREAD_LEVEL_BY_APP_MODEL = {'projects.release': 1}

See the tutorial in the docs to know more about the maximum thread level.


4. The 'custom_comments' demo is an example of how to extend comments provided by django-comments-xtd. The article in this example has comments provided by the app mycomments, which extends django-comments-xtd with a title. Take a look at the docs to know more details.
